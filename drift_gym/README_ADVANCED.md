## üõ∞Ô∏è Feature 1: Sensor Noise Models

### What It Does

Simulates realistic GPS and IMU sensors with noise, drift, and bias instead of providing perfect state.

### Why It Matters

**Real robots don't have perfect state.** They estimate position/velocity from noisy sensors. Training with perfect state leads to policies that fail on real hardware.

### Implementation

```python
from drift_gym.sensors import GPSSensor, IMUSensor

# GPS with drift and noise
gps = GPSSensor(
    noise_std=0.5,        # 0.5m standard deviation
    drift_rate=0.01,      # 0.01 m/s random walk
    dropout_probability=0.01,  # 1% dropout
    update_rate=10.0,     # 10 Hz
    seed=42
)

# IMU with bias
imu = IMUSensor(
    gyro_noise_std=0.01,  # 0.01 rad/s noise
    gyro_bias_std=0.001,  # 0.001 rad/s bias
    update_rate=100.0,    # 100 Hz
    seed=42
)

# Measure
gps_reading = gps.measure(true_position, current_time)
imu_readings = imu.measure(true_angular_vel, true_accel, current_time)

# Handle uncertainty
if gps_reading.valid:
    position = gps_reading.data
    uncertainty = gps_reading.variance
```

### Key Characteristics

- **GPS:**
  - ‚úÖ Multipath error (position-dependent)
  - ‚úÖ Random walk drift
  - ‚úÖ Measurement noise
  - ‚úÖ Satellite dropout
  - ‚úÖ Update rate: 10 Hz

- **IMU:**
  - ‚úÖ Gyroscope bias (random walk)
  - ‚úÖ Accelerometer bias
  - ‚úÖ White noise
  - ‚úÖ Update rate: 100 Hz

### Impact on Observation

**Before:**
```python
obs = [x, y, theta, ...]  # Perfect state
```

**After:**
```python
obs = [
    gps_x, gps_y,              # Noisy measurements
    gps_x_var, gps_y_var,      # Uncertainty estimates
    imu_yaw_rate, imu_yaw_var,
    imu_accel_x, imu_accel_y,
    ...
]
```

## üëÅÔ∏è Feature 2: Perception Pipeline

### What It Does

Simulates object detection with false positives, false negatives, tracking, and confidence scores.

### Why It Matters

**Real perception systems make mistakes.** Cameras and LiDAR have detection errors. Agents must be robust to spurious detections and missed objects.

### Implementation

```python
from drift_gym.perception import ObjectDetector, TrackingFilter, ObjectClass

# Create detector
detector = ObjectDetector(
    max_range=50.0,
    fov_angle=np.pi,           # 180¬∞ field of view
    false_positive_rate=0.05,  # 5% false alarms
    false_negative_rate=0.10,  # 10% missed detections
    seed=42
)

tracker = TrackingFilter()

# Detect objects (with errors!)
detections = detector.detect_objects(
    true_objects, ego_position, ego_heading
)

# Track over time
tracks = tracker.update(detections, dt=0.05)

# Use tracks
for track in tracks:
    print(f"Object {track['id']}: pos={track['position']}, "
          f"confidence={track['confidence']:.2f}")
```

### Key Characteristics

- ‚úÖ Detection range limits (50m)
- ‚úÖ Field of view constraints (180¬∞)
- ‚úÖ False positives (clutter, ghosts)
- ‚úÖ False negatives (missed detections)
- ‚úÖ Confidence scores (decreases with range)
- ‚úÖ Position uncertainty
- ‚úÖ Multi-object tracking

### Typical Performance

- Detection rate: ~90% (within 30m)
- False positive rate: ~5%
- Position error: ~0.3m (increases with range)
- Tracking consistency: >95%

## ‚è±Ô∏è Feature 3: Latency Modeling

### What It Does

Adds realistic delays in the perception-planning-control loop.

### Why It Matters

**Commands don't execute instantly.** Real systems have 50-150ms of latency. Agents must learn to anticipate and compensate for delays.

### Implementation

```python
from drift_gym.sensors import LatencyBuffer

# Create buffer
buffer = LatencyBuffer(
    sensor_delay=0.05,      # 50ms sensor processing
    compute_delay=0.03,     # 30ms planning/inference
    actuation_delay=0.02,   # 20ms motor response
    dt=0.05                 # Simulation timestep
)

# In control loop
buffer.add_action(action)
delayed_action = buffer.get_delayed_action()  # What actually executes

buffer.add_sensor_reading(observation)
delayed_obs = buffer.get_delayed_sensor_reading()  # What agent sees
```

### Latency Breakdown

| Component | Delay | Realistic? |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| Sensor (camera) | 50ms | ‚úÖ Typical |
| Compute (inference) | 30ms | ‚úÖ Typical |
| Actuation (motors) | 20ms | ‚úÖ Typical |
| **Total** | **100ms** | ‚úÖ Realistic |

### Impact

- Agent sees state from 100ms ago
- Actions take 100ms to execute
- Must predict future states
- Reactive policies fail

## üöó Feature 4: 3D Vehicle Dynamics

### What It Does

Extends 2D model with roll, pitch, and weight transfer during acceleration/turning.

### Why It Matters

**Drifting involves lateral forces** that cause body roll and affect tire grip. Weight transfer is critical for realistic vehicle behavior.

### Implementation

```python
from drift_gym.dynamics import Vehicle3DDynamics, Vehicle3DState

# Create dynamics model
dynamics = Vehicle3DDynamics(
    mass=1.5,              # kg
    cog_height=0.05,       # Center of gravity height (meters)
    track_width=0.19,      # meters
    roll_stiffness=100.0,  # N*m/rad
    pitch_stiffness=150.0  # N*m/rad
)

# Initialize state
state = Vehicle3DState(
    x=0, y=0, z=0.05,
    roll=0, pitch=0, yaw=0,
    vx=5, vy=0, vz=0,
    wx=0, wy=0, wz=0
)

# Simulate with weight transfer
new_state = dynamics.step(state, steering=0.4, throttle=0.3, dt=0.05)

# Get individual wheel loads
FL, FR, RL, RR = dynamics.compute_wheel_loads(state, ax=2.0, ay=5.0)
```

### Key Features

- ‚úÖ **Roll dynamics** (lateral acceleration ‚Üí body roll)
- ‚úÖ **Pitch dynamics** (longitudinal accel ‚Üí pitch)
- ‚úÖ **Weight transfer** (affects tire grip)
- ‚úÖ **Individual wheel loads** (FL, FR, RL, RR)
- ‚úÖ **Suspension model** (spring + damper)

### Typical Values

- Max roll angle: ¬±17¬∞ (0.3 rad)
- Max pitch angle: ¬±11¬∞ (0.2 rad)
- Weight transfer: Up to 50% load shift
- Roll stiffness: 100 N¬∑m/rad
- Pitch stiffness: 150 N¬∑m/rad

### Effect on Tire Forces

```python
# Outer wheels carry more load during turn
# ‚Üí More grip available
# ‚Üí Affects vehicle handling

FL_load = 2.5N  # Inner front (light)
FR_load = 4.5N  # Outer front (heavy)
RL_load = 3.0N  # Inner rear
RR_load = 4.7N  # Outer rear
```

## üöô Feature 5: Moving Obstacles

### What It Does

Adds other vehicles and pedestrians with realistic behavior models.

### Why It Matters

**Real world has dynamic traffic.** Static obstacles are too simple. Agents must handle moving objects and predict their behavior.

### Implementation

```python
from drift_gym.agents import MovingAgentSimulator, AgentBehavior

# Create simulator
simulator = MovingAgentSimulator(seed=42)

# Add vehicle following lane
simulator.add_agent(
    position=np.array([10, 0]),
    behavior=AgentBehavior.LANE_FOLLOW,
    size=(2.0, 1.0),
    max_speed=3.0
)

# Add pedestrian crossing
simulator.add_agent(
    position=np.array([5, 5]),
    behavior=AgentBehavior.JAYWALKING,
    size=(0.5, 0.5),
    max_speed=1.5
)

# Update each timestep
simulator.step(dt=0.05)

# Get nearby agents
nearby = simulator.get_agents_in_range(ego_position, max_range=10.0)
```

### Available Behaviors

| Behavior | Description | Use Case |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `STATIONARY` | Doesn't move | Parked cars |
| `STRAIGHT` | Moves straight | Simple traffic |
| `CIRCULAR` | Circular motion | Testing evasion |
| `LANE_FOLLOW` | Follow lane with IDM | Realistic traffic |
| `CUT_IN` | Performs cut-in maneuver | Aggressive driving |
| `JAYWALKING` | Crosses road | Pedestrians |
| `RANDOM_WALK` | Random motion | Unpredictable agents |

### Car-Following Model

Uses **Intelligent Driver Model (IDM)** - industry standard:

```python
# Automatically maintains safe distance
# Adjusts speed based on lead vehicle
# Realistic acceleration/braking
```

### Key Features

- ‚úÖ Multiple behavior types
- ‚úÖ Intelligent Driver Model (IDM)
- ‚úÖ Collision avoidance awareness
- ‚úÖ Predictable trajectories
- ‚úÖ Configurable speeds and sizes

## üìä Observation Space

### Standard Environment (Toy)
```python
obs = [x, y, theta, velocity, ...]  # 10 dimensions
```

### Advanced Environment (Research-Grade)
```python
obs = [
    gps_x,              # Noisy position X (normalized)
    gps_y,              # Noisy position Y (normalized)
    gps_x_variance,     # Uncertainty in X
    gps_y_variance,     # Uncertainty in Y
    imu_yaw_rate,       # Noisy yaw rate (from gyro)
    imu_yaw_rate_var,   # Gyro uncertainty
    imu_accel_x,        # Body acceleration X
    imu_accel_y,        # Body acceleration Y
    num_detections,     # Number of detected objects
    closest_x,          # Closest detection X (may be false positive!)
    closest_y,          # Closest detection Y
    roll,               # Vehicle roll angle (3D dynamics)
    pitch,              # Vehicle pitch angle (3D dynamics)
]  # 13 dimensions
```

### Key Differences

1. ‚úÖ **Includes uncertainty** (variances)
2. ‚úÖ **Noisy measurements** (not ground truth)
3. ‚úÖ **Detection counts** (not perfect object list)
4. ‚úÖ **3D state** (roll, pitch)
